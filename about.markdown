My career started back in college when I volunteered to help the multi-media department of our school. The web was introduced to me while I was assisting the head of the department by burning CDs, helping them in their video production, and sometimes, even buying coffee for him and the other volunteers. From there, I learned how to code and manage a Wordpress site. In 2011 I was hired as a web designer/front-end developer for a small company. The web has taught me a lot of things and I am very thankful for it gave me a career that not only is supplying the needs of my family, but is also helping me grow professionally in my chosen field. 

I was promoted to General Manager back in 2014 and Iâ€™ve been facing spreadsheets and reports since then. I missed coding and would spend some of my free time reading articles and tutorials for neat things with CSS and Javascript.

### This Site

Work for this site will always be ongoing. I've always wanted to try new concepts and technology and creating this simple blog site gives me the opportunity to do them.

If you think something is broken in this website, please hit the email icon at the footer and shoot me a message. I used to be so afraid of messing things up, but not now as it will help me learn faster.
