My career started back in college when I volunteered to help the multi-media department of our school. The web was introduced to me while I was assisting the head of the department by burning CDs, helping them in their video production, and sometimes, even buying coffee for him and the other volunteers. From there, I learned how to code and manage a Wordpress site. In 2011 I was hired as a web designer/front-end developer for a small company. The web has taught me a lot of things and I am very thankful for it gave me a career that not only is supplying the needs of my family, but is also helping me grow professionally in my chosen field. 

I was promoted to General Manager back in 2014 and Iâ€™ve been facing spreadsheets and reports since then. I missed coding and would spend some of my free time reading articles and tutorials for neat things with CSS and Javascript.
