*This was my contribution to a group project for Arts 1. I am sharing this in my blog as a way to give light to people online as to how others are coping financially during this crisis.*

“Kuya nag pi-print ka ba?" It was one weekday morning and my neighbor knocked on our gates asking this question. With her is a piece of paper with scribbles, she gave it to me and asked if I can just type those words and print them. "Magbebenta kasi ako online" she said as she tries to pull out something from her pocket, "magkano ba?". I declined to receive the money and told her she can pay me when I am done. I looked at the paper and decided to help her by designing a label for her business rather done the plain white print out that she requested. I opened Photoshop and started working. 

It was quick work, I had to make it as simple as possible, not too many colors so there will be less ink used in the output.

My neighbor is a stay-at-home mom. Aside from her name, I barely knew her. But from what I can tell, she, just like other moms out there, must do the extra-hustle to help their spouses put food on the table. This crisis has brought out the entrepreneurial spirit among mothers and I admire their dedication in making sure that their families survive this pandemic. 

My neighbor's business is repacking mayonnaise and home-made spread by putting them into smaller jars. She is also selling bread and Chia Seeds. The seeds, known to give nutritional benefits, are sold for 120 PHP.

*The label that I designed was used right away by the client. As a designer, I am a firm believer that proper packaging helps define the identity and boost the sale of 
a product *

I do not know if her husband is one of the million of Filipinos who lost [^1] their job because of COVID-19. What I'm sure of is that she had to do this "sideline" for her family and I am more than glad to lend her my skills, hoping that a properly designed label will boost her sales. I have not designed a label for quite some time. Most of my working hours are spent managing my business and doing site-admin works. Still, the designer in me wants to express and give my best so that the plain jar of bread spread might have its own branding. 

My “client" came back the next day and asked if I am done printing 
the labels. I showed her the finished work and she was glad. She would later share to me on Facebook how the labels fit into her mini-jar. Not the perfect outcome that I was expecting since I used bond paper instead of stickers for the labels. 

“Magkano ba?", she insisted on paying me for the print outs. I wanted to give the labels for free, but I also wanted to give her the pride and dignity of producing these labels herself for the business. "8 pesos per page", I smiled and handed over the labels that I created. She counted coins from her pocket, 32 pesos in total. My entrepreneurial mind suddenly computed the added cost of the labels for each of her products, 9 labels per page divided by 8 pesos. That's .88 additional cost for each jar for a decent label, not bad I told myself.

Art can be used to uplift others. My industry may not be as glamorous as those people who paint for galleries and museums. I talk in pixels, ems, colors, averages, and and more math. I do not consider myself as an artist nor do I belong to a guild or group of artists. Mine is a trade, something that I learned as I hustled building a future for my family. I am a designer which is art combined with problem solving. And I am glad that I was able to design a simple label for a housewife who just wanted to earn extra for her family. Especially in this time of pandemic where every little thing matters.
