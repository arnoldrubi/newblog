Today, I turned 37 and as I express by gratitude to the Lord for His grace in my life, I also began to look back at my career as a generalist and a manager. I started out as a web designer and front-end developer 10 years ago. It was God’s grace that I was promoted twice, to middle manager and then to general manager. Those titles sound “grand”, but for me they are positioned with opportunities to shepherd people. 

Fresh graduates would love to climb up the hierarchy. After all, who would not want to get paid more? But being on the top will cost you. Leading is a full-time endeavor. Being knowledable in almost every aspects of the business is a must. So, I wear many hats. Most of the time I do admin works, managing tasks and people. These took away all the time for me to design and do some projects at work. In the long run, I realized my skills as a designer and developer are slowly becoming rusty. That’s the trade-off of being promoted. You will need to abandon things you love to do in exchange for bigger responsibilities.

There’s an anxiety in me that I could get fired anytime. But the funny thing is that I own the company (I can't fire myself). But yes, we business owners get fired too that is when our venture closes. Hopefully it won’t, but I won’t be too complacent with COVID-19 lingering around and flattening economies worldwide.  I was thinking, hey, maybe I can get back to being just a front-end developer/designer and do the things I love doing many years ago. However, quick searches on Job Street tell me that my current skillset is irrelevant. Many job openings today require technologies that were not present during my time.
Then, I stumbled upon this random tweet from Nick.

It gave me encouragement that I still can learn those JS Frameworks or those neat CSS technologies. I do have good years of working using the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS). 

Today, I am officially rolling up my sleeve and will start to learn again and hope to rust off my skills as a web designer and front-end developer. I am not doing this only for job security, but also to focus again on the first job that I loved to do – building websites or web apps.

I will start with the language that gives the Web life, Cascading Style Sheets or CSS. If HTML is the technology that gives websites its bones, marrows, and tissues and muscles, CSS is its skin, hair, and everything you see on the outside. It’s funny that back in 2010, it took me days just to style a button with curved edges (hello CSS positioning and “image/css hacks").

No, I am not leaving. Aside from being the boss (or mid-boss, my founding partner from the US is the big boss), I believe polishing again my skillsets will benefit the business. I won’t get overwhelmed with the technologies present today and will focus on what I can learn now and start building from there.
