I still remember when I was still in college, my friend and I used to talk about UP OU and its course BSMMA (Bachelor of Science in Multi Media Arts), on how we would love to someday enroll to that program. Having earned a 2-year vocational diploma, I realized the need for a bachelor’s degree while I am slowly working my way up in our company. The need for more knowledge about design and its “business” became clear to me during my first 2 years after my promotion. Sadly, the traditional school setup won’t be possible for me as I work 8 to 10, sometimes 12, hours a day. And even though I work at home, the time commuting from our home to school will take a big chunk of my time.

Good thing I remembered UP OU and its program now called Bachelor of Arts in Multi Media Studies or BAMS. I talked to my wife and asked for her approval as this is a big step that will not only affect my working hours but also my time with her and our son. I submitted my requirements and took the exam in which I am still amazed at how I was able to pass. This is probably the part where my friends would pop the champagne and throw confetti to celebrate the victory - this is not. The real work starts here and I now realized, after studying at UP OU for more than a month that I need to work harder if I want to wear the sablay.

I have listed my takeaways from my UPOU experience so far. I am sure I will learn more as the days, weeks, and months pass by. 

READ EVERYTHING AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THEM, TRIPLE CHECK EVERYTHING

Our My Portal, the place where are classes are constructed, is not that hard to navigate. But, I had one big mistake that almost cost me my grade. I forgot to finalize my submitted assignment in WIKA1. My son was hospitalized and was sick the whole September so I never went back and checked my assignment. I thought I already pressed the submit button after I uploaded my file. Still, Mr. Petras, our professor, was merciful to accept the draft submission. I was lucky enough that the FIC or faculty-in-charge gave us a free pass for this one as there are others who failed to finalize their submission. This will not work all the time. So this is really a big lesson for me. 

BANDING TOGETHER > BEING A LONE WOLF

I joined a Facebook group of BAMS student at the start of the semester. One might want to just traverse the courses alone, but just like the traditional school setup, joining a band of fellow learners will not only help you along the way, but will also start and forge new friendships.

My classmates shared resources or learning materials in our courses. I am thankful for one classmate for sharing the pdf version of a particular book. I was thinking of buying the printed version of that book because I am not always in front of my laptop to read the one uploaded on www.scribd.com. Our group also created a shared calendar which became my default one since I have to look at the deadlines of quizzes and activities every now and then. This takes me to the last point which is: 

TO PLAN AHEAD AND NOT PROCRASTINATE IS GOLDEN

Distance learning gives a lot of benefits, but only to those who are disciplined enough to manage their time. The temptation to delay reading and doing assignments will not go away since I am not required to go to class on a fixed schedule. I have discovered that self-accountability is required to survive in this learning setup. I gave up some activities so I can spend time reading the materials. I kept a notebook to take notes from what I’ve read. At my age, I’m no longer good anymore at memorizing things so I bought a notebook to jot down thoughts and important things to remember. There are things that will be sacrificed, but I always tell myself to never give up the time for my family. After all, they are the reason why I am hustling at work and at UP OU. I remember what my former boss said, “If you don’t plan things ahead. Somebody will do it for you”. So I’ve learned to plan in micro details now that I need to spend my time wisely.
