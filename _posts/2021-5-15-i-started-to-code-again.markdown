The last 3 years have been extra challenging than usual. As a group, we were able to resolve a major conflict at work that could have been disastrous if left alone. Then, there is the birth of my eldest and then my second child which are 3 years apart. If there is anything certain during these difficult times, I must say that God’s grace is sufficient for me and my family for us to carry on. 
The challenges at work and my personal life took a lot of time and as the years go by, I realized my coding skills are becoming more and more rusty. As what I have said over my previous blog, I will begin to roll up my sleeves and learn front-end development once again. 
I began my quest by creating this site and tinkering it to fit my desire of a simple, custom site for blogging. I am using Jekyll for starters and modified the existing Minima theme that is bundled along with the default Jekyll installation. 
If there is something important that I picked up early on is that you can learn looking at how other people work. Coding is no different. It is quick (for me) to experiment and learn by looking and editing existing codes. If I messed up, I’ll just put back the last part and run again.

Three things that I’ve learned these past weeks as I went back to coding.

1.	Grid
2.	Flexbox (it’s not Grid vs Flexbox, no no)
3.	Git

I’m already familiar with numbers 1 and 2. I use flexbox at work, and I also took a short course on CSS Grid years ago. Putting these two into an actual project is rewarding. Back in the olden days we would divs like crazy and position them using floats. I even had the windows calculator open to compute the sizes in pixels for the boxes using relative sizing (those days where we memorized this formula: target width / parent width).

And Git! Wow, I use git to download plugins and project folders. I even started this blog using GitHub for Desktop. But I only had a good understanding on Git after I watch this [primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) by Traversy Media

One thing that the author perfectly put it on at the beginning. Learning using the command line is effective. Thank you! So, I hope I’ll get good at Git. lol
Starting up and learning is about trial and error. Some people are good at retaining knowledge through reading and memorizing. But coding is not like that. I am sure even experienced developers still make mistakes, look at other people’s work, and even use Google when they are stuck at something. To be honest, I am not even ashamed to tell everyone that I had to Google how to do the nesting on my scss file. Cheers!
